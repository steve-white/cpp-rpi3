# Overview

This repo contains a number of conan files to build third party C++ libraries targeting the Raspberry Pi 3.
Most target armv7 so they may be compatible with the Rpi 2 as well.

The output will generate binaries in a bintray binary repository which can be used as a conan remote when building C++ projects
